# Cyberbully Detection Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a balanced dataset for cyberbully detection in social media. The dataset has been carefully curated and labeled to enable researchers and developers to build accurate cyberbully detection models. It includes various types of cyberbullying instances, such as race/ethnicity, gender/sexual, and religion-related content, as well as non-cyberbullying instances. This dataset is for the paper *Self-Training for Cyberbully Detection: Achieving High Accuracy with a Balanced Multi-Class Dataset*.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of a total of approximately 100,000 tweets collected from social media platforms. It is labeled with a multi-class classification approach, where each tweet falls into one of the following categories:

Non-cyberbullying: 50,000 instances
Race/Ethnicity-related cyberbullying: 17,000 instances
Gender/Sexual-related cyberbullying: 17,000 instances
Religion-related cyberbullying: around 16,000 instances
The dataset's balance ensures equal representation of each class, allowing for effective training and evaluation of cyberbully detection models.

## Data Format
The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. Each row represents a tweet, and the columns include:

* *text*: The text content of the tweet.
* *label*: The category label indicating the type of cyberbullying or non-cyberbullying content.

## Usage
Researchers and developers interested in cyberbully detection can leverage this dataset to explore different machine learning and deep learning techniques. The balanced nature of the data facilitates the development of models that are robust and effective in detecting various types of cyberbullying instances. We encourage the use of this dataset to contribute to a safer online environment.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the dataset or add additional labeled instances are welcome. You can submit modifications or enhancements through pull requests.
